Notes:
    - use models everywhere
    - no magic bs

Utils module:
    - common methods -> helpers
    - constant files -> database, signal, extraction

Raw data extraction module
    - needs modularization
    - extract common methods in utils 

Graphing module
    - will be used in tandem with raw extraction module 
    - simple signal graphing abstractizations

Data access module:
    - define models 
    - ensure data manipulation for the desired features

Feature module:
    - methods for converting signals into features
    - that s about it really. 

Nice to have:
