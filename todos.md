# Todos

- [ ] Use classes for all unassigned methods (at least static ones)
- [ ] Add comments
- [ ] Use typing in all methods
- [ ] Maybe set bin count to be specific per property, not per discretizer.
- [X] Create class index method instead of 0 else 1
- [ ] Order methods in classes (private, protected, public)
- [X] Add multithreading / multiprocessing for the user files, add locks for data access
- [X] Since the program uses only trials with quadrant classification 1 or 3, don't create useless records and process data for nothing
- [ ] Make histograms for the training data for the relevant features in each state (happy / sad)
- [ ] Add classifier adaptor content as data access method
- [ ] Move input model class in models
- [ ] Check the naive classifier, I think P(Ck) is missing and should be calculated in order to be multiplied to the final product
- [ ] Switch to using logs when calculating probabilities in bayes, since a 0 value for a bin means a final 0 probaility
