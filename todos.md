# Todos

- [ ] Use classes for all unassigned methods (at least static ones)
- [ ] Add comments
- [ ] Use typing in all methods
- [ ] Maybe set bin count to be specific per property, not per discretizer.
- [X] Create class index method instead of 0 else 1
- [ ] Order methods in classes (private, protected, public)
- [X] Add multithreading / multiprocessing for the user files, add locks for data access
- [ ] Since the program uses only trials with quadrant classification 1 or 3, don't create useless records and process data for nothing
- [ ] Make histograms for the training data for the relevant features in each state (happy / sad)
